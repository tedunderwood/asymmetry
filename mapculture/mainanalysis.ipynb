    "This is an offshoot of a larger project, which is evolving slowly. We spun this off to make a subsidiary point. It branched from the main project back at [```../analysis/third_model_analysis1.ipynb.```](https://github.com/tedunderwood/asymmetry/blob/master/analysis/third_model_analysis1.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "We've edited this notebook so that it not only tests the hypotheses tested in the ```third_model``` notebook, but does so using two different metrics: KL divergence and cosine distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "For weird historical reasons, different passes at this project got described as \"first supplement,\" \"second supplement,\" and so on. (We kept adding a few more volumes to the model to test hypotheses more thoroughly.) The results we're using here are described as \"fourth supplement,\" but the underlying metadata and topic model are the same as those used in the \"third supplement.\" The fourth supplement is just a calculation run on the third supplement that keeps better track of cosine distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the code used to measure the temporal asymmetries, see ```calculate_supp4_kld.py``` in this folder, and the worker script it calls, ```kld_calc_worker_supp4.py```\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis in this notebook begins after those Python scripts have run on the campus cluster (it's a compute-intensive process and we split it both across multiple nodes and across multiple cores in each node). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python scripts produce a series of \"summary files\" that describe novelty, transience, and (what Barron et al call) \"resonance\" for each volume. In the article text, we are probably going to rename resonance something like \"anticipation.\" We calculate this on cosine distance quite simply by subtracting the cosine distances measured from a given text *forward* (\"transience\") from the cosine distances measured *backward* (\"novelty\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### complexities of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We measured novelty and transience across temporal windows of different sizes (10, 25, and 40 years). We also experimented with a measurement that uses only the 5% or 20% of volumes closest to a given work when doing the calculation. These options make a slight difference, but in reporting results we emphasize an approach that uses a 25-year window, and all volumes in that window. That's the approach we originally preregistered. (Actually, we planned to use 10-, 20-, and 50-year windows, but slightly adjusted the plan when we realized a 50-year window would just produce a lot of NaNs).\n",

The underlying theory here is that having a lot of copies in a library is a sign that a book was \"ahead of its time,\" either in the causal sense that it sold a lot of copies and therefore had an *influence* on the future, or in the reverse-causal sense that it became (retrospectively) attractive to librarians because literary history happened to move in its direction. Our experiment doesn't currently allow us to distinguish those causal mechanisms.\n",

    "In each case, we've developed a very cautious test, to avoid worries about confounding variables. For each hypothesis set of volumes we have randomly selected a contrast set (matched as closely as practical to the hypothesis set in genre, nationality, and date). The [matching strategy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2943670/) is a way of addressing confounding variables without some of the slipperiness of a complex regression.\n",

    "The test we are relying on as actually confirming the hypothesis is a pre-registered one: we measure resonance at the 25-year window, using all the volumes. This is the column ```resonance_1.0_25.``` (Actually, we pre-registered a plan to test 10, 20, and 50-year windows, whereas here we have 10, 25 and 40 year windows, but the difference between 20- and 25-year windows is not determinative at all.) For the sake of guiding future research, we also run a version of this test using only the 5% of volumes closest to the work in a given year."
