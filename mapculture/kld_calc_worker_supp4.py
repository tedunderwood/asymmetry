def get_kld_timelines(package):
    '''
    Calculates Kullback-Leibler divergence forward and back in time
    for a "segment" of rows in the metadata frame.

    Accepts as its argument a 3-tuple that should be:

    1 metadata DataFrame
    2 doc-topic proportions (data), as a DataFrame indexed by docid
    3 segment, a 2-tuple (startposition, endposition)

    Returns three objects:

    1 A set of three timelines for each volume. Each timeline records
    the average KLD at a temporal offsets from - 50 years to + 50 yrs.
    There are three different timelines for each vol, because we calculate
    the mean within different fractions of the total distribution: all
    the vols at that offset, the bottom 0.05 of klds, or the bottom
    0.025 of klds.

    2 summary statistics listing the novelty, transience, and resonance
    averaged over different timespans and fractions. For def of novelty,
    transience and resonance see Barron et al. (2018).

    3 cosine-distance calculated backward and forward in time. This is not
    something we're necessarily planning to use in the experiment, but
    it's here to permit various kinds of sanity checking.
