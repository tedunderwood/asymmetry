metadata
=========

**topicsample.tsv** is the metadata originally selected for topic modeling. 38,653 volumes, selected from a deduplicated sample (workmeta.tsv in the noveltmmeta repo), and evenly distributed across time 1800-2009, except that they're a little sparse before 1830. Typically with a sample this large you lose some for various reasons (not actually present in EF, etc). So ...

**filteredsample.tsv** are the volumes I actually had available for topic modeling--the ones present in the model.
